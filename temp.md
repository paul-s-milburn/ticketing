Microservices with Node JS and React
Required MongoMemoryServer Updates
In the upcoming lecture, we will be setting up our test environment with MongoMemoryServer. If you are using the latest versions of this library a few changes will be required:

In auth/src/test/setup.ts, change these lines:

  mongo = new MongoMemoryServer();
  const mongoUri = await mongo.getUri();
to this:

  mongo = await MongoMemoryServer.create();
  const mongoUri = mongo.getUri();


Remove the useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology parameters from the connect method. Change this:

  await mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useUnifiedTopology: true,
  });
to this:

  await mongoose.connect(mongoUri, {});


Then, find the afterAll hook and add a conditional check:

afterAll(async () => {
  if (mongo) {
    await mongo.stop();
  }
  await mongoose.connection.close();
});


Lastly, find the beforeEach hook and add a conditional check:

beforeEach(async () => {
  if (mongoose.connection.db) {
    const collections = await mongoose.connection.db.collections();
 
    for (let collection of collections) {
      await collection.deleteMany({});
    }
  }
});
